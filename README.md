Ohio Scientific Computer Disk Image Utility
-------------------------------------------

OSI computers were sold in the computers were sold in the 
late 1970s/early 1980s.  I happen to have an OSI model C3A
which has three CPUs (6502, 6800, Z80) and a whopping 48k of
memory.

In the process of reviving the old system I realized some of the
old 8 inch floppies were getting a bit flacky.  Time to get images
of these old diskettes before they are lost forever.

I used a C3dump utility to  copy the raw disk data to a linux 
server but I wondered if these were valid images.

This utility is intended to help validate that disk images are
correctly formated.  I can also be used to convert images
from ascii to binary or vice vera.
